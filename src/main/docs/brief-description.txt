User Stories
- The customer wants to serve ads. The ad server should deliver the advertising media as JSON
and/or XML. 

I have used JSON for client which exposes rest for clients.

- An advertising media ("ad") is composed of a title, image, and a target URL for clicks.

- The customer wants to be able to define advertising spaces for placement of ads on a website 
      Advertising spaces are identified by a unique id which is sent in the ad request
      Once an advertising space for a website is defined, only advertising media with matching dimensions may be served
      Example: if an advertising space has a dimension of 100x100, only advertising media with 100x100 may be served
      The ads must not be static. They should be selected randomly from the pool of available advertising media

To support multiple images, images can be stored on local filer while link, target url and details about the ad, ad space are stored in database.
	  
- Advertising media should be grouped by advertising campaigns so it is possible to activate/deactivate multiple ads at once.
      Campaigns must have an active/inactive flag
      Campaigns may have periods of validity, time spans in which the contained advertising media may be served
      Campaigns have a limit how often the contained ads may be served. Once the limit is reached, no ads from the campaign are to be served.
      It should be accessible how often ads from the campaign have been served

- Access must be password protected.
    Have used basic authentication mechanism and is defined in web.xml. Have made certain assumptions here. Please refer to assumption text.

- Bonus:
   It should be possible to assign categories to advertising spaces and filter campaigns to only deliver on spaces belonging to categories specified in the category filter.
   The categories should be inventoried, so only assignment of categories known to the system should be possible.
   The categories should have a tree structure.
   The the category filter should match also on descendants of the categories configured in the filter.
   
   I am using pre cached categories and used Graph to traverse to get descendants of a particular category.
